The Silence Of Kashmir:
This project is an interactive horror-style based experience by using JS and p5.js. The idea behind my artwork is to explore the theme of violence and fear through sounds, pictures and interactive stuff i added in. 

What my project is about:
This project is split into 4 pages and each one of the pages explores a difference type of fear and atmosphere. Page 1 is the intro and it shows a dark and gloomy atmosphere.  Page 2 indicates people looking at you which is the idea behind occupation by other countries. I also added whit flickering showing that occupation is tense and than anything can happen. There is also blood dripping from the eyes (hopefully its noticable). Page 3 is the flag of kashmir i put on. it indicates killing and blood. The text "its just a dream" indicates that we may not get freedom and may be in occupation for however long we live and page 4 talks about confusion and "why" we are like this. there are fast moving texts so have a go and try to read them!

Challenges:
For someone who DISPISES JS, i found this quite hard at the beggining. I had no idea what to do. Then i had an idea and went with it as i had no time at all. The project turned out very well at least as someone who is a begginer coder. I had ALOT of setbacks to a point where i had to delete majority of my code as I was all over the place. Overall, at the end i did enjoy this project as I genuinly had alot of fun making stuff that I thought would be very hard. The flickering for exaple was simple and i already has an idea of how to do it. But the eye movement for example was very hard and i struggled on it aswell as it had alot of red brackets

What i learned:
Throught this project i learned how hard p5.js can REALLY be knowing i have to make everything through scratch. and throught this i learned alot of stuff such as how mant fucntions can work such as random. it makes stuff move quicker and have some sort of flicker movement on my text. I learned how to make glitches and gradients. I also learned how to track the mouse and use it to animate. In this instance the pupils. I didnt expect to learn this much from a project, but doing everything manually inside JS has helped mee understand coding better 

Overall, I am proud of what I created concidering my skill level and the amount of time I had left due to my mistakes. The project communicates fear, violaent and silence in the way I intended. There are many parts that could have been imporved and definitley some more features i could have added to achieve a higher grade. But the core idea is strong. It includes identification in each page, the user interacts with creepy elements, the artwork blends symbolism with visual affects and the atmosphere changes in each page.

This project did challenge me, fustrate me, suprise me and somewhat made me enjoy coding!
Even though i struggled, i feel like ive achieved something which i thought i could never do and it meant alot.
